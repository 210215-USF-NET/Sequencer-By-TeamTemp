# RevMixer Application by Team RevMixer
The purpose of RevMixer is to allow users to utilize a sequencer to compose, play, and save short looping sections of music.
For musicians, ideas for melodies or musical fragments can pop up out of nowhere. Without an easy and reliable way of recording these sounds,
they can easily be forgotten. Revmixer provides the framework for musicians to express and share their creativity wherever they may be.
